                  Land deformation, including subsidence, uplift, and lateral
                  shifts, occurs due to various natural and anthropogenic
                  factors such as tectonic activity, groundwater extraction,
                  mining, and infrastructure development. Remote sensing,
                  particularly <b>Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)</b>,
                  has revolutionized the monitoring of land deformation by
                  providing precise, high-resolution measurements over large
                  areas. Sentinel-1, a radar satellite mission from the
                  European Space Agency (ESA), is widely used for deformation
                  studies due to its all-weather, day-and-night imaging
                  capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Advanced InSAR techniques, such as{" "}
                  <b>Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PS InSAR)</b> and{" "}
                  <b>Small Baseline Subset (SBAS)</b>, allow for long-term
                  monitoring of slow-moving deformations by analyzing phase
                  changes in radar signals over multiple acquisitions. PS InSAR
                  is effective in urban environments with stable reflectors
                  like buildings, while SBAS is suitable for detecting broader
                  ground movements over vegetated or rural regions.{" "}
                  <b>Differential InSAR (D-InSAR)</b> is another widely used
                  technique that compares two SAR images acquired at different
                  times to measure surface displacement with{" "}
                  <b>millimeter-level accuracy.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For <b>landslide detection</b>, remote sensing techniques
                  such as <b>InSAR, optical imagery, and LiDAR</b> are used to
                  analyze slope instability, ground movement patterns, and
                  post-landslide changes. Sentinel-1’s{" "}
                  <b>InSAR time-series analysis</b> provides early warnings of
                  slope deformation, while high-resolution optical data from
                  Sentinel-2 or commercial satellites helps classify
                  landslide-affected areas. Integrating these remote sensing
                  techniques enhances disaster preparedness, risk assessment,
                  and mitigation strategies for land deformation and associated
                  hazards.

              <p>
                Groundwater depletion in Delhi and its associated land
                deformation were analyzed using Sentinel-1 SAR data and the
                Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) technique by processing Single Look
                Complex (SLC) interferograms. The observed land deformation in
                the Delhi region was around -3 mm per 12 days, with the majority
                concentrated in the New Delhi area. Additionally, GRACE-derived
                groundwater anomalies indicated a significant depletion of
                groundwater, with a total loss of over 50 cm from 2003 to 2022.
                The area of analysis covered a 0.5° x 0.5° grid.

                The earthquake that struck Khost City, Afghanistan, on June 22,
                2022, triggered significant landslides and land deformation,
                causing extensive damage to infrastructure and livelihoods. For
